Requirements:
  - Take example from 6.6.3.
  - Refactor using CMP instead of .IF .ELSEIF etc.
  - Prompt user for input values of:
    a.) Grade Average
    b.) Credits
  - Credits has to be from range 1-30
  - If entry is invalid, output error message
  - Output outcome of evaluation ("student can/cannot register!")

First Thoughts:
  - This seems super easy
  - Maybe I should make a flowchart of the original logic

Steps:
  0.) At the top of the paper goes my name with the date!
  1.) Ask the user what their Grade average is.
  2.) Ask the user what their credit(s) is.
  3.) If the credit amount is invalid tell them to double-check.
  4.) If the amount is valid, check for the Grade Average 
  5.) If the Grade average is SUPER high they can automatically register.
  6.) If the grade average is above 250 AND they have more than 16 credits, they can register.
  7.) Anything else is automatically not allowed.
